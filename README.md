Raytracer written in plain javascript. Supports multiple threads using web workers, lambertian, metallic and dielectric materials. Currently can render flat plains and spheres.

There are some bugs; this was primarily written as a learning project.

Here's a link to a running version with a random scene of spheres pictures above:
